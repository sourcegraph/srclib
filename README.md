# srclib [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sourcegraph/srclib.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sourcegraph/srclib)

*Note: srclib is alpha.
[Post an issue](https://github.com/sourcegraph/srclib/issues) if you have any
questions or difficulties running and hacking on it.*

[**srclib**](https://srclib.org) is a source code analysis library. It provides standardized tools,
interfaces and data formats for generating, representing and querying
information about source code in software projects.

**Why?** Right now, most people write code in editors that don't give them as
much programming assistance as is possible. That's because creating an editor
plugin and language analyzer for your favorite language and editor combo is a
lot of work. And when you're done, your plugin only supports a single language
and editor, and maybe only half the features you wanted (such as doc lookups and
"find usages"). Because there are no standard cross-language and cross-editor
APIs and formats, it is difficult to reuse your plugin for other languages or
editors.

We call this the **M-by-N problem**: given *M* editors and *N* languages, we
need to write (on the order of) *M*&times;*N* plugins to get good tooling in
every case. That number gets large quickly, and it's why we suffer from poor
developer tools.

srclib solves this problem in 2 ways by:

* Publishing [standard formats and APIs](https://srclib.org/api/data-model/) for
  source analyzers and editor plugins to use. This means that improvements in a
  srclib language analyzer benefit users in any editor, and improvements in a
  srclib editor plugin benefit everyone who uses that editor on any language.

* Providing high-quality language analyzers and editor plugins that implement
  this standard. These were open-sourced from the code that powers
  [Sourcegraph.com](https://sourcegraph.com).

See [srclib.org](https://srclib.org) for more information.

Currently, srclib supports:

* **Languages:** [Go](https://sourcegraph.com/sourcegraph/srclib-go), [JavaScript](https://github.com/sourcegraph/srclib-javascript), and [Ruby](https://github.com/sourcegraph/srclib-ruby) (coming very soon: [Python](https://sourcegraph.com/sourcegraph/srclib-python) and [Java](https://github.com/sourcegraph/srclib-java))

* **Integrations:** [emacs-sourcegraph-mode](https://srclib.org/plugins/emacs/),
  [Sublime Text](https://srclib.org/plugins/sublimetext/), and
  [Sourcegraph.com](https://sourcegraph.com)

* **Features:** jump-to-definition, find usages, type inference, documentation
  generation, and dependency resolution

Want to extend srclib to support more languages, features, or editors? During
this alpha period, we will work closely with you to help you.

what you're building to get started.


## Usage

See [*Getting started*](https://srclib.org/gettingstarted/) for installation
instructions.

Once you install srclib's `srclib` tool and language support toolchains, you'll use
srclib by installing an editor plugin in your editor of choice. [See all editor plugins.](https://srclib.org/gettingstarted/)

# Misc.

* **bash completion** for `srclib`: run `source contrib/completion/srclib-completion.bash` or
  copy that file to `/etc/bash_completion.d/srclib` (path may be different
  on your system)
